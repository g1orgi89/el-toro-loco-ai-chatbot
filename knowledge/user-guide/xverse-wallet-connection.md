2. Look for the "Connect Wallet" button in the top right corner
3. Click the connect button to start the process

### 3. Select Xverse Wallet

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Connection Failed
- **Check Extension**: Ensure Xverse extension is installed and enabled
- **Unlock Wallet**: Make sure your Xverse wallet is unlocked
- **Refresh Page**: Try refreshing the Shrooms website

## Security Best Practices

### Wallet Security
- **Never share your seed phrase** with anyone
- **Verify the URL** - always ensure you're on the official shrooms.io domain
- **Use hardware wallets** for large amounts
- **Keep your browser updated** for the latest security patches

### Connection Safety
- **Only connect to trusted dApps** like Shrooms
- **Review permissions** before signing transactions
- **Disconnect when not in use** if using a public computer

## What You Can Do After Connecting

Once your Xverse wallet is connected to Shrooms, you can:

- **Participate in staking** to earn rewards
- **Provide liquidity** to farming pools
- **Vote on governance proposals** (when DAO features are live)
- **Claim airdrops** and special distributions

## Advanced Features

### Bitcoin Name System (BNS)
If you have a BNS name registered, it will display instead of your wallet address for easier recognition.

### Multiple Accounts
Xverse supports multiple accounts. You can switch between them within the extension and reconnect to use different accounts with Shrooms.

## Getting SHROOMS Tokens

To participate fully in the Shrooms ecosystem, you'll need SHROOMS tokens:

1. **DEX Trading**: Use decentralized exchanges like ALEX or StackSwap
2. **Liquidity Mining**: Provide liquidity to earn SHROOMS rewards
3. **Community Events**: Participate in airdrops and community distributions

## Network Information

Shrooms operates on the **Stacks blockchain**, which is secured by Bitcoin. Ensure your Xverse wallet is configured for:
- **Network**: Stacks Mainnet
- **Currency**: STX (for transaction fees)
- **Token Standard**: SIP-010 (for SHROOMS tokens)

Remember: Connection to Shrooms is free, but you'll need a small amount of STX for any on-chain transactions like staking or trading.
